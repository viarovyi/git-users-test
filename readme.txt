github.com has public API to get list of users: "https://api.github.com/users". There are helpfull parameters like "per_page" and "since", check them.
You need to create iOS application, which allows to get list of github users loaded into table. Each row contains login, profile link (html_url) and avatar preview(100x100). Clicking on avatar preview should result in opening bigger avatar version (about 400x400)

We expect application will allow to browse at least first 100 users.
Using Swift is required.

Source code should be available on github.com.
